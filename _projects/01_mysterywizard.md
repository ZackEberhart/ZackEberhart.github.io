Mystery Wizard!? is an assymetrical strategy board game for 2-6 players. The goal is to solve the enigmatic Mysteries by stealing them and letting the local nerd figure the rest out. Also you need to do it twice.

I designed MysWiz with my frineds Jackson Warley and Aiden Giuffre. We started working on it in 2015, and it finally found a publisher in GMT Games in 2019. It's currently in preproduction, and hopefully it'll be on shelves in summer 2020.

Check out this announcement trailer I made, it took so long to find the appropriate music.
