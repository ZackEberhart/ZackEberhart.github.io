<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">On the Hexed Isle, there stands a Tower. Only the noblest of heroes are worthy to unlock the Mysteries of the Tower and save the Isle from encroaching madness. Unfortunately, the best wizards around are a desperado, a baby dragon, and a sand witch... We're all doomed.</p>

Mystery Wizard!? is an asymmetrical capture-the-flag-style strategy board game featuring 8 playable wizards with totally unique playstyles. Players cast spells and complete side quests to earn rewards as they compete to retrieve the Mysteries from the central tower.

I designed MysWiz with my friends Jackson Warley and Aiden Giuffre. As of 2019, it has officially been greenlit at GMT games, and is awaiting production.
