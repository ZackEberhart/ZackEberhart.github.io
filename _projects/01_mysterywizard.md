Mystery Wizard!? is an asymmetrical strategy board game for 2-6 players. The goal of the game is to solve the enigmatic Mysteries before anybody else. To do you so, you must steal the Mysteries from the eldritch Tower, and rush them back to your village while warding off your opponents. Also you need to do it twice.

I designed MysWiz with my friends Jackson Warley and Aiden Giuffre. We started working on it in 2015, and it finally found a publisher in GMT Games in 2019. It's currently in preproduction, and hopefully it'll be on shelves in summer 2020.

Check out this announcement trailer I made. It took about three days to put together using Adobe Premiere. Half of that time was spent trying to find the appropriate music.
