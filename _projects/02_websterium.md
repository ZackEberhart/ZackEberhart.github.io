Ghost in the Cell is a web game inspired by the board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_(board_game)">Mysterium</a> by Libellud. It is a cooperative deduction game in which one player is a ghost and the rest are psychics working together to solve the mystery of the ghost's murder. To do so, the psychics receive "visions" in the form of texts containing memes, gifs, or whatever silly photos the ghost can access. The ghost must use the images available to them to try to guide the individual psychics towards specific suspects, places, and murder weapons.
