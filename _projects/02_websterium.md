Ghost in the Cell is a webapp adaptation of the board game [Mysterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_(board_game)) by Libellud. Mysterium is a cooperative game in which one player is a ghost and the rest are psychics working together to solve the mystery of the ghost's murder. To do so, the psychics receive "visions" in the form of cards depicting abstract art, that the ghost must use to try to guide the individual psychics towards specific suspects, places, and murder weapons.
